Tryton Markup for Sphinx
########################

The *sphinxcontrib-tryton* package is an extension to Sphinx_.  It aims to
allow better documentation for Tryton_ by providing a ``tryton`` domain and
other features which are then used to query a ``trytond`` server and get
information and screenshots from a Tryton installation.

This extension was inspired by the trydoc_ extension.
