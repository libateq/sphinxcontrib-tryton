Usage
=====

The purpose of the *sphinxcontrib-tryton* extension is to provide markup that
allows better Tryton documentation.  Once configured correctly the markup can
be used to pull data directly from a ``trytond`` server and add screenshots
from the Tryton desktop client or Sao.  This enables you to create
documentation that is easier to keep up to date with any changes to the Tryton
codebase.
